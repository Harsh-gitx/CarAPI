         "description":"Porsche is known for building engineering marvels on wheels that go very fast. The German sportscar maker made sure that their SUVs, the Cayenne and the Macan were equally sporty. The Macan is the smaller of the two and was launched a few years ago. Now it has received its first mid-life update and will be launched in India soon after the new Cayenne.",
