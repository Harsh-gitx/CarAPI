"description": "The Audi Q7 has been largely popular in the Indian market and with the launch of the new generation Q7 last year, the flagship Audi SUV has managed to stay in the front of the race for large luxury SUVs. But the Ingolstadt-based manufacturer has always missed one thing in the Q7 – a powerhouse performance car. Yes, they had the 500bhp 6.0-litre V12 oil-burner, but it never really appealed like the ML 63 AMG or the BMW X5M.",
